Finally from a Gaussian distribution is introduced. This is a core method to learn for sampling linear parameters and will be expanded upon in the next Chapter to the multi-variate case.

    "### Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis method is by far the most well-known of all of the MCMC sampling methods due to it's ease of implementation, tunability, and effectiveness. The Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are effective as all samples with a higher likelihood are accepted, while some samples with lower likelihoods will be accepted from time to time (this can be helpful to avoid becoming stuck around a local likelihood peak). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say we wish to sample for some parameter $\\omega$. Let $\\omega_j$ represent te $j$th sample of $\\omega$ in a Markov chain. We also need to define a stochastic proposal probablility distribution, $T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid \\omega_{j})$, with which we tune in order to help with parameter convergence. In the Metropolis method, the proposal distribution is symmetric, i.e., $T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid \\omega_{j})=T(\\omega_{j}\\mid \\omega_{j+1})$. In the Metropolis-Hastings method, this proposal distribution need not be symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing we need to define is the acceptance criterion, which tells us which samples we will accept and which ones we will not. This acceptance criterion is defined by the ratio of the densities, which is given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities as defined by Bayes' theorem ($\\frac{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j})}$). If a prior is used to inform our sampling, this ratio is weighted by the ratio of the prior probabilities. Therefore our total definition of the acceptance probability $q$ is defined as\n",

    "Now we're really getting some practical stuff done! Hopefully you've gained some understanding of the theory behind sampling for parameters, and how it is done in practice as well. Now that we have the base infrastructure built, we want to expand to more and more realistic examples. Let's introduce some more foregrounds which you can create classes for and simulate a more complex data set. Let's add two more components, thermal dust emission, and the CMB. These are two good components to introduce as they are prevalent in total intensity, as well as in polarization. Recall that we are working in Rayleigh-Jeans units, and will introduce the parametric models for these components in such units. And as a consistent reminder, details on microwave sky foregrounds can be found in the online lectures.\n",
