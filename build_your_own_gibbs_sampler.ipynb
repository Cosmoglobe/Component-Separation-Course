    "The Metropolis method is by far the most well-known of all of the MCMC sampling methods due to it's ease of implementation, tunability, and effectiveness. The Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are effective as all samples with a higher likelihood are accepted, while some samples with lower likelihoods will be accepted from time to time (this can be helpful to avoid becoming stuck around a local likelihood peak). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say we wish to sample for some parameter $\\omega$. Let $\\omega_j$ represent te $j$th sample of $\\omega$ in a Markov chain. We also need to define a stochastic proposal probablility distribution, $T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid \\omega_{j})$, with which we tune in order to help with parameter convergence. In the Metropolis method, the proposal distribution is symmetric, i.e., $T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid \\omega_{j})=T(\\omega_{j}\\mid \\omega_{j+1})$. In the Metropolis-Hastings method, this proposal distribution need not be symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing we need to define is the acceptance criterion, which tells us which samples we will accept and which ones we will not. This acceptance criterion is defined by the ratio of the densities, which is given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities as defined by Bayes' theorem ($\\frac{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j})}$). If a prior is used to inform our sampling, this ratio is weighted by the ratio of the prior probabilities. Therefore our total definition of the acceptance probability $q$ is defined as\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q = \\frac{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j})}\\frac{P(\\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\omega_j)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "With these defined, we can now outline the algorithm itself. The algorthim is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialie chain at some parameter value $\\omega_0$.\n",
    "2. Draw a random sample from the proposal probability distribution, i.e., $\\omega_{j+1} \\leftarrow T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid\\omega_j)$.\n",
    "3. Compute the acceptance probability $q$.\n",
    "4. Draw a random number $\\eta$ from a uniform distribution $U[0,1]$.\n",
    "5. Accept the proposed $\\omega_{j+1}$ if $\\eta < q$. Otherwise, set $\\omega_{j+1} = \\omega_{j}$.\n",
    "6. Repeate steps 2-5 until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside:\n",
    "Tuning of the Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings step size is vital to properly exploring the distribution within a realistic number of samples. Having a step size which is too small can make exploring the full distribution too expensive as many steps are accepted without the sampled values moving much. When the step size is too large, very few samples are accepted, wasting a large amount of time drawing samples, again not exploring the distribution well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning the step size though testing to accept between 20 and 80 % of the samples will provide you a sampling procedure that allows for good exploration of the underlying distribution."

    "Now that we have sampled the two amplitude parameters, we want to sample spectral parameters, which do not depend linearly on the data $d$, and are not Gaussian distributions, hence demand a different approach. \n",
    "To sample these two conditional distributions, we employ the \"inversion sampler\", which is completely general and works for all univariate distributions.\n",
    "In our case, we have the distribution\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this for $P(\\beta)$ we can sample using the inversion sampler by following the procedure:\n",
    "1. Compute $P(\\beta)$ over a grid in $\\beta$, making sure to probe the tails to sufficient accuracy.\n",
    "2. Compute the cumulative probability distribution, ${F(\\beta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\beta} P(\\beta')\\,\\mathrm d\\beta'}$.\n",
    "3. Draw a random uniform variate, $\\eta \\sim U[0,1]$.\n",
    "4. Solve the nonlinear equation $\\eta = F(\\beta)$ for $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can extend this sampling scheme for any parameter, amplitude or spectral parameter. To do so, we simply grid out the distrubution $P(x)$ for parameter $x$."

    "Now that we have sampled two parameters separately, while holding the other constant, we can introduce Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling is the core of the Commander and Cosmoglobe frameworks, and is a useful tool for mapping out multi-dimensional parameter spaces. Consider a data model with some set of parameters $\\vec{\\omega} = \\{\\omega_0,..,\\omega_k\\}$. We utilize Bayes Theorem, as defined earlier, to explore this parameter space. Gibbs sampling functions by sampling each of these parameters $\\omega_{i}$ individually, while holding all of the parameters constant. Therefore, in each Gibbs chain there are $k$ steps, such that we draw samples in the following way\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we're really getting some practical stuff done! Hopefully you've gained some understanding of the theory behind sampling for parameters, and how it is done in practice as well. Now that we have the base infrastructure built, we want to expand to more and more realistic examples. Let's introduce some more foregrounds which you can create classes for and simulate a more complex data set. Let's add two more components, thermal dust emission, and the CMB. These are two good components to introduce as they are prevalent in total intensity, as well as in polarization. Recall that we are working in Rayleigh-Jeans units, and will introduce the parametric models for these components in such units. And as a consistent reminder, details on microwave sky foregrounds can be found in the online lectures.\n",
