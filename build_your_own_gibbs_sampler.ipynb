    "\n",
    "The Metropolis method is by far the most well-known of all of the MCMC sampling methods due to it's ease of implementation, tunability, and effectiveness. The Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are effective as all samples with a higher likelihood are accepted, while some samples with lower likelihoods will be accepted from time to time (this can be helpful to avoid becoming stuck around a local likelihood peak). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say we wish to sample for some parameter $\\omega$. Let $\\omega_j$ represent te $j$th sample of $\\omega$ in a Markov chain. We also need to define a stochastic proposal probablility distribution, $T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid \\omega_{j})$, with which we tune in order to help with parameter convergence. In the Metropolis method, the proposal distribution is symmetric, i.e., $T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid \\omega_{j})=T(\\omega_{j}\\mid \\omega_{j+1})$. In the Metropolis-Hastings method, this proposal distribution need not be symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing we need to define is the acceptance criterion, which tells us which samples we will accept and which ones we will not. This acceptance criterion is defined by the ratio of the densities, which is given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities as defined by Bayes' theorem ($\\frac{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j})}$). If a prior is used to inform our sampling, this ratio is weighted by the ratio of the prior probabilities. Therefore our total definition of the acceptance probability $q$ is defined as\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q = \\frac{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\boldsymbol d \\mid \\omega_{j})}\\frac{P(\\omega_{j+1})}{P(\\omega_j)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "With these defined, we can now outline the algorithm itself. The algorthim is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialie chain at some parameter value $\\omega_0$.\n",
    "2. Draw a random sample from the proposal probability distribution, i.e., $\\omega_{j+1} \\leftarrow T(\\omega_{j+1}\\mid\\omega_j)$.\n",
    "3. Compute the acceptance probability $q$.\n",
    "4. Draw a random number $\\eta$ from a uniform distribution $U[0,1]$.\n",
    "5. Accept the proposed $\\omega_{j+1}$ if $\\eta < q$. Otherwise, set $\\omega_{j+1} = \\omega_{j}$.\n",
    "6. Repeate steps 2-5 until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside:\n",
    "Tuning of the Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings step size is vital to properly exploring the distribution within a realistic number of samples. Having a step size which is too small can make exploring the full distribution too expensive as many steps are accepted without the sampled values moving much. When the step size is too large, very few samples are accepted, wasting a large amount of time drawing samples, again not exploring the distribution well.\n",
